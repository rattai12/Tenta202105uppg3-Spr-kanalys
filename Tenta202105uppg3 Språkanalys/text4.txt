LONDON - An illegal bitcoin mine has been found by police in the
U.K. who were looking for a cannabis farm.

The mine - located in an industrial unit on the outskirts of the
English city of Birmingham - was stealing thousands of pounds worth of
electricity from the mains supply, West Midlands Police said Thursday.

Police searched the unit in Sandwell on May 18 on the back of
intelligence that led them to believe it was being used as a cannabis
farm.

Many people were visiting the unit at various points of the day,
police said, adding there were numerous wiring and ventilation ducts
visible. A police drone also detected a lot of heat coming from the
building.
